Tunable Function Generator

This project involves the design and implementation of a Tunable Function Generator capable of generating sine, square, and triangular waveforms. The key feature of this function generator is tunability â€” both the magnitude and frequency of the waveforms can be controlled using potentiometers.

1.Generates three types of waveforms:

Sine Wave

Square Wave

Triangular Wave

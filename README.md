Tunable Function Generator

This project involves the design and implementation of a Tunable Function Generator capable of generating sine, square, and triangular waveforms. The key feature of this function generator is tunability â€” both the magnitude and frequency of the waveforms can be controlled using potentiometers.

1.Generates three types of waveforms:
SINE WAVE:
A sine wave is defined by a smooth, periodic oscillation characterized by a continuous wave-like pattern. It is foundational in signal processing, used in various applications including audio and radio signals.
SQUARE WAVE: 
A square wave is a non-sinusoidal waveform that switches abruptly between high and low states. It is widely used in digital electronics and signal processing, where it represents binary states.
TRIANGULAR WAVE:
A triangular wave is a periodic, non-sinusoidal waveform characterized by its triangular shape. It's a piecewise linear, continuous real function where the rise and fall times are equal

2.Tunability:
Frequency and amplitude of each waveform can be varied using potentiometers.
The formulas for frequency is prooved in attached images for sine , square and triangular wave.

3.Components:
DSO,Power Supply,Breadboard,Connecting Wires,Opamps,Diodes,Resistors,Capacitors,Potentiometer.

HOW WAVEFORMS ARE GENERATED?

The flow is sine wave---->square wave---->triangular wave.

1.SINE WAVE:
Based on a Wien Bridge Oscillator circuit.

2.SQUARE WAVE:
Based on non-inverting Schmitt Trigger circuit.

3.TRIANGULAR WAVE:
Based on integrator circuit.

HOW IS FREQUENCY AND AMPLITUDE CONTROLLED?

1.Potentiometer provides variable resistance thus wide range in frequency.
2.Non
